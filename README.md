## Project Topic: Palmoria Group HR Analytics Report 

### Project Overview

This project is an evaluation of recent concerns and public criticism around gender inequality at Palmoria Group, this report presents a thorough analysis of the company’s human resource data across its three operational regions. Commissioned by the CHRO, Mr. Yunus Shofoluwe, this analysis aims to uncover disparities in workforce representation, pay structure, and performance evaluations with a particular focus on gender.

### Data Source

The primary source is a csv file of employee data of Palmoria Group and an Additional Excel file for calculation of employee Bonus 

### Tool used
- Power Bi[Download here](www.microsoft.com)
   - For Data Cleaning
   - For analysis and visualization
   - For creating a report

### Key data cleaning steps were taken to ensure accuracy:
 • Employees with missing salary data (no longer with the company) were excluded.
 • Rows with missing department names were removed.
 • Missing gender values were standardized to “Undisclosed” to maintain inclusiveness.

Through visual exploration using Power BI, the analysis revealed:
 • A noticeable gender imbalance across departments and regions, with some units entirely male-dominated.
 • Signs of gender related performance rating gaps, which may point to unconscious bias in evaluations.
 • A clear gender pay gap, particularly within certain departments such as Engineering and Procurement.
 • Several employees are earning below the $90,000 minimum salary recently mandated by regulation especially concentrated in Region C.
 • Bonus payments, while linked to performance ratings, do not always reflect actual employee performance, requiring policy review.

Using intuitive charts, filters, and interactive visuals with no advanced formulas or DAX the report distills critical insights for management action.

Recommendations include:
 • Auditing and correcting the gender pay gap across departments.
 • Ensuring all salaries comply with the $90,000 minimum threshold.
 • Ensure bonus allocation more transparently with employee performance.
 • Improve recruitment and development strategies to accomodate gender balance.
